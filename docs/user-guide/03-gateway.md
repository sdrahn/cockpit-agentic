# 3. Connecting Custos to mcp-gateway

mcp-gateway is where an agent's tools come from and where its rights are
decided. This chapter sets up the gateway side for agents on the same
host: the servers they use, who approves their calls, and delegation
between agents. Agents in OpenShell sandboxes reach the gateway over
HTTPS instead; that is [chapter 11](11-openshell.md).

## How an agent reaches the gateway {#socket}

An agent with the default `systemd` backend connects to the gateway's
MCP socket `/run/mcp-gateway/mcp.sock` (`gateway.socket` in its
configuration). Its unit runs it as `agent-<name>` with the supplementary
group `mcp-users`, the group that owns that socket. The gateway
identifies it by the socket's peer credentials (`SO_PEERCRED`) as the
principal `agent-<name>`, transport `unix`; nothing the agent says about
itself changes that. The agent announces itself as the MCP client
`custos/<name>`.

The agent's unit hides the gateway's control socket
(`/run/mcp-gateway/control.sock`) and SELinux keeps `agent_t` from it,
so an agent can never decide an approval.

## The policy module and the agents' data {#agent-data}

The package installs `/usr/share/mcp-gateway/policy/custos/agents.rego`,
a module of the gateway's policy package `mcp.authz`. mcp-gateway's
policy engine (OPA, `mcp-opa.service`) loads it with the gateway's
shipped policy. It reads each agent's data from
`/etc/mcp-gateway/policy/agents/<name>.yaml`:

```yaml
patch-pilot:
  mode: supervised
  paused: false
  permissions:
    - {server: zypp, tool: 'list_*', read_only: true}
    - {server: zypp, tool: install_patches}
```

`agent-admin` writes these files; do not edit them by hand. OPA picks up
a change within seconds, and `agent-admin` waits (up to 20 seconds) until
OPA has it before it returns, so a change is in force when the command
ends. The same directory holds `_control.yaml` (the emergency stop) and
`_http.yaml` (the token issuers of agents over HTTPS). OPA watches only
directories it loaded a file from at start, which is why all of them
live in this one directory.

For an agent principal, the agent's data is the only source of rights:

- an `agent-*` principal without data gets nothing;
- a gateway role bound to an agent's user (in the gateway's role data)
  would bypass its mode, so the module denies that agent everything.
  Never bind roles to `agent-*` users or to `agent-clients`.

## Registering the MCP servers agents use {#servers}

An agent can only call tools of servers the gateway has. Register them
as for any client, usually with mcp-gateway's setup packages, which
install the server definitions:

```bash
zypper install mcp-gateway-profile-zypp mcp-gateway-profile-systemd
systemctl reload mcp-gateway.service
curl -s --unix-socket /run/mcp-gateway/control.sock http://localhost/v1/servers | grep -o '"name":"[^"]*"'
```

The setup packages also ship roles (`zypp-reader`, `systemd-operator`,
…) for people. Agents do not use them: bind those roles to people only.
What an agent may call comes from its permissions
([chapter 6](06-permissions-and-modes.md)).

Two lists decide what reaches an agent:

| Where | Decides |
|---|---|
| `gateway.servers` (and `gateway.tools`) in the agent's `agent.yaml` | which tools the model is *shown* |
| the agent's permissions (`agent-admin permissions`) | what the gateway *allows* |

A tool the agent may not call is hidden from it by the gateway as well
(it answers `not offered`).

## Who may approve an agent's calls {#approvers}

The gateway's approver rules say who may decide a server's approvals.
They are part of the gateway's role data, `/etc/mcp-gateway/policy/rbac/data.yaml`
(until you write one, the shipped default `/usr/share/mcp-gateway/rbac/data.yaml`):

```yaml
# /etc/mcp-gateway/policy/rbac/data.yaml (excerpt)
approvers:
  default: [self, 'role:admin']
  zypp: ['role:admin', 'group:agent-approvers']
  systemd: ['role:admin', 'group:agent-approvers']
```

- In the shipped default, `wheel` is bound to the role `admin`, so
  members of `wheel` may approve everything.
- `self` (a user approving their own request) never applies to agents:
  agent users have no password. Name approvers explicitly for every
  server agents use.
- Start from a copy of the shipped default so its roles and bindings
  stay: `cp /usr/share/mcp-gateway/rbac/data.yaml /etc/mcp-gateway/policy/rbac/data.yaml`.
- Check what is in force with `mcp-gateway-admin policy show`.

## Links to the Custos page in approval notices {#approval-links}

The gateway names a page where an approval is decided: in the notice
it sends the agent ("Waiting for approval of … at <URL> …") and in its
notifications to approvers (desktop notification, mail, webhook; the
gateway's `oob` channel). To send people to the Custos page, set its URL
template in the gateway's configuration (a drop-in in
`/etc/mcp-gateway/gateway.d/`):

```yaml
# /etc/mcp-gateway/gateway.d/40-custos.yaml
approvals:
  url_template: https://host.example.com:9090/custos#/approvals/{id}
```

Then `systemctl reload mcp-gateway.service`. Inside the Custos page,
activities and the chat link to the Approvals tab themselves, whatever
the template says.

## Delegation between agents {#delegation}

Agents delegate tasks to each other through the gateway, as the tool
`agents__delegate`. The package ships the server definition; enable it
by copying it:

```bash
cp /usr/share/custos/gateway/servers.d/agents.yaml /etc/mcp-gateway/servers.d/agents.yaml
systemctl reload mcp-gateway.service
```

The gateway runs the bridge `agent-delegate` as the delegating agent's
user (SELinux `mcpsrv_agents_t`). It posts the task to the other agent's
socket and waits for the result. Allow it per agent, naming whom it may
delegate to:

```yaml
- {server: agents, tool: delegate, read_only: true, args: {agent: '^patch-pilot$'}}
```

The callee works under its own mode, permissions and approvals: a
delegation never lends one agent's rights to another. In supervised mode
the delegation itself needs an approval unless the permission says
`read_only: true`. The Activity tab shows the chain from the first
activity to the last ([chapter 8](08-cockpit.md#activity)).

## Checking the connection {#check-connection}

After creating an agent ([chapter 4](04-first-agent.md)):

```bash
curl -s --unix-socket /run/agents/patch-pilot/api.sock http://agent/v1/status | jq .gateway
# {"socket": "/run/mcp-gateway/mcp.sock", "reachable": true}
journalctl -u mcp-gateway.service -o cat --since -10min | grep '"sub":"agent-patch-pilot"'
```

`reachable: false` or no gateway records: see
[chapter 12](12-troubleshooting.md#gateway).
