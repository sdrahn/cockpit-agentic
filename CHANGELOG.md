# Changelog

All notable changes to Custos. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Within contract version 1
(CONTRACT.md), names, paths and fields are added, never renamed or
removed.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-11-04

The first release: governed AI agents on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 16
and openSUSE Leap 16, supervised from Cockpit, with every tool call
decided by mcp-gateway (≥ 1.12).

There is nothing to upgrade from. Install `custos` and `custos-selinux`,
and optionally `custos-cockpit` and `custos-docs`, from the OBS
packages. The user guide, chapters 2 to 4, goes from the installation to
a first agent whose change waits for an approval. The OpenShell backend
is a draft (CONTRACT.md O10).

### Added

- **Agents.** Each agent is a Google ADK Go agent, run by systemd as its
  own system user (`agent@<name>.socket`, `agent@<name>.service`) and
  started on demand by its socket. It is configured in
  `/etc/custos/agents/<name>/agent.yaml`. Models are any
  OpenAI-compatible server (on-premises, air-gapped), Gemini, or
  Vertex AI. Credentials are kept with `systemd-creds`. Each agent has
  limits on model calls, tool calls and run time, and its schedules run
  as systemd timers.
- **Governance in mcp-gateway.** The policy module
  `/usr/share/mcp-gateway/policy/custos/agents.rego` enforces three
  autonomy modes: `advisory`, `supervised` (the default; a new agent can
  do nothing until it is given permissions) and `bounded`. Approvals are
  decided as the person, through the gateway. Pause, and the emergency
  stop (`agent-admin stop-all`, `release-all`), are enforced by the
  gateway on every backend.
- **Control API and audit.** Each agent serves its status and activities
  on `/run/agents/<name>/api.sock`, identifying callers by their peer
  credentials. It writes journal records with `AGENT_*` fields and their
  own `MESSAGE_ID`s, joined with the gateway's audit from proposal to
  execution. Chat runs over AG-UI.
- **Delegation** between agents through the gateway's `agents` server
  (`agent-delegate`), with the chain traced to its origin.
- **`agent-admin`**: `create`, `edit`, `check`, `delete`, `mode`,
  `permissions`, `set-credential`, `pause`, `resume`, `stop-all`,
  `release-all`, `trigger`, `list`, `show`. Changes are in force when
  the command returns.
- **OpenShell sandboxes** (draft): agents in NVIDIA OpenShell, reaching
  the gateway's HTTPS listener with OAuth tokens that OpenShell renews.
  The control API is relayed with the caller, and the agent's records
  reach the host journal. The relay unit waits until the sandbox is
  Ready.
- **Cockpit page** (`custos-cockpit`): the Activity, Approvals, Agents,
  Policy and Audit tabs, chat, creating, editing and deleting agents,
  and the emergency stop. It is tested in a real Cockpit with SELinux
  enforcing.
- **SELinux** (`custos-selinux`): `agent_t` for the agents,
  `mcpsrv_agents_t` for delegation, and `agent_relay_t` for the
  OpenShell relay.
- **Functional tests** (`custos-tests`) for openQA:
  `/usr/libexec/custos/tests/run-tests.sh --disposable --results DIR`,
  writing TAP and JUnit.
- **User guide** (`docs/user-guide`, package `custos-docs`): installing,
  connecting to mcp-gateway and an identity provider (Keycloak and
  others), configuration, permissions and modes, approvals, the Cockpit
  page, administration, monitoring and audit, OpenShell, troubleshooting
  with every error message, and a reference. `custos-docs` installs it
  with the contract in `/usr/share/custos/docs`, together with a
  collection file from which mcp-docs serves it to agents on the host.
- **The contract** (`CONTRACT.md`), version 1: the interface between
  the agent hosts and the control plane.
